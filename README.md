# Flutter Chat and Firebase Backend

A chat app made using flutter and firebase 😀

**⚠️ The App Is In Early Development**

The builds will be added soon to repository to directly try 😁

It uses Firebase authentication to sign in and sign up for users. It uses Firestore as database to store user information, messages, etc.

**Here are some screenshots**
